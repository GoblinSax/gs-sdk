# Goblin Sax SDK
  
A javascript library to take loans on NFTs from Goblin Sax. The library can installed thru npm using:

 > npm i @goblinsax/gs-sdk

A detailed explanation for the SDK is [here](https://equable-song-6a9.notion.site/Goblin-Sax-Integration-Guide-b7e52f7c9f62438692ecf80b8e2ac873#712bfefd31e04938866cc4246eb3659a). Alternatively, the endpoints explained there can be used to manually create the loan.

Refer to examples/example.js for a loan example on rinkeby thru a terminal script. A hardhat fork implementation on the mainnet and a react sample app will be added shortly.
